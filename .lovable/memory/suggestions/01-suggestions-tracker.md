# Suggestions Tracker

## Completed Suggestions

### Model Picker & Catalog
- [x] Interactive numbered model selection with range/mixed syntax
- [x] 81-model GGUF catalog with rich metadata (params, quant, size, RAM, capabilities)

- [x] RAM-based filter with auto-detection via WMI
- [x] Download size filter (5 tiers: Tiny to XLarge)
- [x] Speed tier column (instant/fast/moderate/slow based on fileSizeGB)
- [x] Speed-based filter with multi-select support
- [x] 4-filter chain: RAM -> Size -> Speed -> Capability
- [x] aria2c accelerated downloads with Invoke-DownloadWithRetry fallback
- [x] .installed/ tracking for model downloads
- [x] Starred models (recommended) grouped first with color-coded ratings

### Hardware Detection
- [x] CUDA GPU detection (nvidia-smi, nvcc, WMI) for executable variant filtering
- [x] AVX2 CPU support detection for CPU-only fallback variants
- [x] Incompatible variants skipped with clear logging

### New Models Added (v0.26.0)
- [x] Gemma 3 (1B, 4B, 12B) from Google

- [ ] SHA256 checksums in catalog for download integrity verification
- [ ] Parallel model downloads using aria2c batch input file mode

### Medium Priority
